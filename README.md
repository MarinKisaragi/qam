Changes for future version 1.3

* Organized the help command into categories. Syntax becomes /help (category). Available categories: bondage, character, chat, clothing, escape, fun, misc, talking, visual, zones.
* Integrated the Moaner script, thanks to Myrhanda and Kimei for their permissions :) - The moaner commands are unchanged. Tip: To avoid conflict with BCX, enable BCX before loging.
* New command: bg2 to use the hidden Platform backgrounds. Must be followed by a number between 1 and 45. /bg2 0 will give the list of the concerned backgrounds.
* New command: friendlist to have access to friendlist inside a chat room, with clickable links to other rooms during 15 seconds.
* New command: ggts to enter ggts training in asylum at some level for a specified time. More than 180 minutes is possible. The level must be between 1 and 6.
* New command: lock to add locks on all lockable items, on yourself or another player. The lock type is specified by a number between 1 and 16. The syntax is different according the used lock, as all concerned parameters (except the hint for locks with password) can be defined.
* New command: name to change the name of your character. Normal characters (also from non-English alphabets), numbers and spaces are accepted.
