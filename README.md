Notes: 
* The new anims and poses are based and/or inspired by the BCE addon https://sidiousious.gitlab.io/bce/ - the command names anim2 and pose2 have been choosen to avoid conflict with this addon. The QAM anims are launched by a command, they are not triggered by a specific action or word.
* The diapers command actually integrates the BC-Diaper-Wetter script created by Firefly - see https://github.com/mrbakucamp/BC-Diaper-Wetter - Thanks for the permission :)
